"""The ``--hardware`` gate holds for a path named on the command line.

ADR-0005's suite drives the only unit this project has, and ``--hardware`` is the
flag that means "yes, touch my unit". ``tests/hardware/conftest.py`` needs two
hooks to say that once, because pytest answers the question two different ways:

* a path pytest REACHES by walking the tree is offered to
  ``pytest_ignore_collect``, which vetoes it - so ``pytest`` and ``pytest tests/``
  collect nothing from that directory;
* a path NAMED on the command line is never offered to that hook at all. It was
  collected and then RAN: with a unit attached it drove the unit, and with none
  attached it failed rather than being absent. A developer narrowing a run to one
  file lost the gate without being told.

This file pins the second half, which is the half that rots silently - the first
half goes on working, so the suite stays green while the gate is gone. It checks
through a subprocess running the developer's own command rather than asserting
about the hook, because the hook is not what was wrong: pytest's choice of when
to call it was.

Nothing here can reach a unit even if the gate is broken. Every subprocess runs
with ``hid`` poisoned (see :func:`_poisoned_hid`), so a hardware test that
escapes the gate dies at ``connect()`` instead of driving somebody's amp. An
offline test may never touch the unit (ADR-0002), least of all this one.
