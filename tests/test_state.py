# at 10.04 s these four inside ten milliseconds, in this order:
#
#     RecallPreset     ['action', 'preset', 'reason']
#     SetlistPosition  ['action', 'folder_key', 'is_factory', 'position']
#     PresetDirty      ['action']            (is_dirty has no presence)
#     Scene            ['action', 'selected_scene']
#
# Two of them mark an entry and the next one answers it in full. Without the
# rule that a complete push clears the mark, every one of those entries would
# cost a round trip on first access - which is what "warm for free" is supposed
# to mean, and what the acceptance criteria ask for by name.
