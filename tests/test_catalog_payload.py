"""The committed `ModelRepo` payload still generates the committed snapshot.

`tests/fixtures/catalog/model_repo_coros_4_0_1.bin` is the reply the 4.0.1 unit
sent on 2026-09-22. It exists so a snapshot can be regenerated with no unit
attached (ADR-0022), which is the only way a contributor without that firmware
can touch the generated catalog at all.

A saved input nothing reads is a file that rots silently. The offline suite
would pass identically if this payload were truncated, from the wrong firmware,
or replaced with noise, and `tests/hardware/test_generated_constants.py` cannot
help: it reads the unit, not this file. So the check that matters is the one
below - regenerate from the payload and compare with what is committed.

This is NOT the hardware check. That one asks whether the snapshot still matches
the UNIT, and only a unit can answer it. This one asks whether the snapshot
still matches its own recorded input, which is what makes regeneration
reproducible for someone who has no unit.

    Nearly everything is caught above: a truncated payload raises while the

    design and by its own docstrings, so a model this repository generates no

    Measured, not supposed: adding one model that carries a `sku` and a

    option list, leaves `models.py`, `params.py` and `options.py` byte for byte
    identical. The model count is the only thing that moves.
