"""The model's cache against a real unit: does it hear, and does it stay quiet?

The offline suite proves the rules: what merges, what forces a re-read, what a
write watcher makes of an echo. It cannot prove the two facts the whole design
rests on, because both are claims about a real unit:

* **the connect burst warms the cache**, so a value read straight after
  connecting costs no round trip;
* **a change the model did not make reaches it**, unasked, with no read.

Both are checked here. So is the third claim the design leans on hardest - that
the metronome's tempo stream, which never stops, costs nothing at all.

**State neutrality (ADR-0005).** Two tests edit the unit: each sets one parameter
on the first occupied block of the loaded preset and restores the value it read
first. That is the same edit ``test_write_echo.py`` makes, for the same reason -
it is the smallest change the unit announces. It leaves the loaded preset marked
as having unsaved changes, which is what an edit does and what discarding it
would have to un-do by throwing the owner's work away. Nothing here saves,
recalls, deletes or renames anything.

**Dirty pushes are not a per-edit contract.** The first edit of a clean preset
gets an announcement. An already-dirty preset has both stayed silent and restated
true on this firmware, so the write-through check decides from what actually
arrived during its window.

To exercise the confirmed branch from a known clean start, run::

    pytest tests/hardware --hardware -k write_through

Both outcomes are pinned: a matching push confirms, while silence times out and
forces a corrective read.
