"""The hardware-in-the-loop suite's fixtures, and its restore contract.

ADR-0005: a successful run is **state-neutral** - everything the suite changed is
put back. A failed run restores as best it can and NAMES what it could not, so
the owner knows what to fix by hand. This is not a nicety: the only unit this
project has is one somebody gigs with.

Run it with::

    pytest tests/hardware --hardware

Without the flag nothing here runs, so the offline suite stays honest with no
unit attached. That takes two hooks, not one: ``pytest_ignore_collect`` for the
paths pytest REACHES by walking the tree, and ``pytest_collection_modifyitems``
for a path named on the command line, which pytest never offers to
``pytest_ignore_collect`` at all.

    pytest does not consult ``pytest_ignore_collect`` for a path given as a
    command-line argument - only for paths reached by walking a directory - so
    narrowing a run to one file used to walk straight past the gate. With a unit
    attached those tests RAN and drove it; with none attached they failed rather
    than being absent. ``--hardware`` is the flag that means "yes, touch my
    unit", and losing it without being told is the one thing this suite must not
    do.

    That exemption is OBSERVED, not promised: it is in pytest's code (the
    ``isinitpath`` checks in ``Dir.collect``) and not in its hookspec, which says
    the hook is consulted for all files and directories. Read as behaviour rather
    than contract - and the direction of the risk is fine either way. If pytest
    ever matches its code to its docs, a named path becomes uncollected, this hook
    sees no items, and ``tests/test_hardware_gate.py`` fails on the exit code
    while the gate itself gets STRONGER.

    This hook does see explicitly-named paths, which is why the gate lives here
    as well. It raises rather than deselecting quietly: the developer asked for
    these tests by name, so the reason they did not run is owed to them, and a
    deselected count in a summary line is not that reason.

    No test runs either way. The named modules are imported first, since that is
    what collecting them means, and that is safe by a standing constraint rather
    than by luck: the hardware modules must stay import-safe offline (STEERING
    § 6), and nothing at their module scope touches a device.

    One connection, because the handshake is expensive - and because the unit

    This is a PROTOCOL-level suite, so it connects through
    :mod:`pyquadcortex.protocol` and gets a ``QuadCortex``.
    ``pyquadcortex.connect()`` returns the model's ``Device`` instead (ADR-0006).

    Two things are attached before the handshake, and neither can be attached
    later on demand, because the burst happens during ``connect``:

    * the burst recorder, for every run rather than only the tests that read it;
    * the model's state layer, which is what ``pyquadcortex.connect()`` does at
      exactly this point. It stays attached for the whole run, which costs the
      RX thread one small message copy per ``Version`` or ``PresetDirty`` push
      and nothing at all for anything else - orders of magnitude under the
      hundred-millisecond latencies ``test_write_echo.py`` measures. Its own
      tests are in ``test_model_state.py``.

    The fixture then waits for the burst to finish before handing the connection
    over, so the recording is exactly the burst whatever order the tests run in.
    It costs about 8 s once per run and buys more than it costs: `connect()`
    returns roughly 3 s before the unit starts streaming several hundred messages,
    so without the wait every latency measurement in this suite would be taken on
    a link that is still busy answering the handshake.
