"""The hardware-in-the-loop suite's fixtures, and its restore contract.

ADR-0005: a successful run is **state-neutral** - everything the suite changed is
put back. A failed run restores as best it can and NAMES what it could not, so
the owner knows what to fix by hand. This is not a nicety: the only unit this
project has is one somebody gigs with.

Run it with::

    pytest tests/hardware --hardware

Without the flag nothing here runs, so the offline suite stays honest with no
unit attached. That takes two hooks, not one: ``pytest_ignore_collect`` for the
paths pytest REACHES by walking the tree, and ``pytest_collection_modifyitems``
for a path named on the command line, which pytest never offers to
``pytest_ignore_collect`` at all.

    With ``--hardware`` it does the profile bookkeeping instead (ADR-0020):
    every ``verifies()`` name is checked against ``QuadCortex.operations()``,
    ``--verifies`` narrows the run to the tests that name one operation, and the
    names of what SURVIVES that are recorded for the end-of-run report (see
    :func:`_claims`). The check runs at COLLECTION
    so a marker naming an operation that no longer exists stops the run before
    the unit is touched, and ``tests/test_hardware_gate.py`` - which collects
    this tree offline with ``hid`` poisoned - sees it too.

    pytest does not consult ``pytest_ignore_collect`` for a path given as a
    command-line argument - only for paths reached by walking a directory - so
    narrowing a run to one file used to walk straight past the gate. With a unit
    attached those tests RAN and drove it; with none attached they failed rather
    than being absent. ``--hardware`` is the flag that means "yes, touch my
    unit", and losing it without being told is the one thing this suite must not
    do.

    That exemption is OBSERVED, not promised: it is in pytest's code (the
    ``isinitpath`` checks in ``Dir.collect``) and not in its hookspec, which says
    the hook is consulted for all files and directories. Read as behaviour rather
    than contract - and the direction of the risk is fine either way. If pytest
    ever matches its code to its docs, a named path becomes uncollected, this hook
    sees no items, and ``tests/test_hardware_gate.py`` fails on the exit code
    while the gate itself gets STRONGER.

    This hook does see explicitly-named paths, which is why the gate lives here
    as well. It raises rather than deselecting quietly: the developer asked for
    these tests by name, so the reason they did not run is owed to them, and a
    deselected count in a summary line is not that reason.

    No test runs either way. The named modules are imported first, since that is
    what collecting them means, and that is safe by a standing constraint rather
    than by luck: the hardware modules must stay import-safe offline (STEERING
    § 6), and nothing at their module scope touches a device.

    One connection, because the handshake is expensive - and because the unit

    This is a PROTOCOL-level suite, so it connects through
    :mod:`pyquadcortex.protocol` and gets a ``QuadCortex``.
    ``pyquadcortex.connect()`` returns the model's ``Device`` instead (ADR-0006).

    Two things are attached before the handshake, and neither can be attached
    later on demand, because the burst happens during ``connect``:

    * the model's state layer FIRST - see ``subscribe`` below, where the order
      is load-bearing - which is what ``pyquadcortex.connect()`` does at
      exactly this point. It stays attached for the whole run, which costs the
      RX thread one small message copy per ``Version`` or ``PresetDirty`` push
      and nothing at all for anything else - orders of magnitude under the
      hundred-millisecond latencies ``test_write_echo.py`` measures. Its own
      tests are in ``test_model_state.py``;
    * the burst recorder, for every run rather than only the tests that read it.

    The fixture then waits for the burst to finish before handing the connection
    over, so the recording is exactly the burst whatever order the tests run in.
    It costs about 9 s once per run and buys more than it costs: `connect()`
    returns roughly 3 s before the unit starts streaming several hundred messages,
    so without the wait every latency measurement in this suite would be taken on
