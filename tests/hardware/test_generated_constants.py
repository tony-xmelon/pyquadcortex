"""The generated constants still match the unit's own catalog.

`models.py` and `params.py` are generated from a device's ModelRepo and then
COMMITTED, so they are a snapshot. A firmware or content update can renumber a
parameter or add a model, and nothing offline can notice - the generated file is
its own yardstick. This regenerates from the connected unit and compares.

A failure here is not necessarily a bug. It means the snapshot is stale, and the
fix is to regenerate and read the diff before committing it:

    python scripts/generate_models.py
    python scripts/generate_params.py
    python scripts/generate_options.py

Read the diff. A renumbered parameter is a real protocol change and belongs in
`docs/protocol.md`; a new model is routine.
