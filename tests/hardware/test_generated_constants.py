"""The generated constants still match the unit's own catalog.

`models.py` and `params.py` are generated from a device's ModelRepo and then
COMMITTED, so they are a snapshot. A firmware or content update can renumber a
parameter or add a model, and nothing offline can notice: since ADR-0022
`tests/test_catalog_payload.py` holds the snapshot against the payload it was
generated from, but that payload is a capture of one moment, so the two move
together and agree while the unit has moved on. This regenerates from the
connected unit and compares.

Which snapshot it compares against comes from the CONNECTED PROFILE (ADR-0020)
rather than from a fixed path, so a unit on some other firmware is held against
its own snapshot, or told it has none yet.

A failure here is not necessarily a bug. It means the snapshot is stale, and the
fix is to regenerate that profile's snapshot and read the diff before committing
it:

    python scripts/generate_models.py --snapshot coros_4_0_1
    python scripts/generate_params.py --snapshot coros_4_0_1
    python scripts/generate_options.py --snapshot coros_4_0_1

Read the diff. A renumbered parameter is a real protocol change and belongs in
`docs/protocol.md`; a new model is routine.
