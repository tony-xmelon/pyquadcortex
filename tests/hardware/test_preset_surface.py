"""The model's preset surface, against a real unit.

The acceptance criterion this exists for: read a real preset through the model
and assert it matches what the protocol layer reports for the SAME preset -
blocks, positions, routing, splits and scene labels. Two accounts of one payload,
one in the wire's numbering and one in the screen's, held against each other.

The offline suite checks the same conversions against a fixture. What it cannot
check is that the fixture still looks like what the unit sends, which is the gap
this closes.

Read-only except for one test, which activates a scene and puts it back. Nothing
here saves anything, so a run that dies badly leaves nothing a preset recall does
not undo.
