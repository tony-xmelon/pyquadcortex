"""The scale fixture still matches the unit's own catalog.

`tests/fixtures/catalog/scales.json` holds the bounds, taper and floor of every
parameter the offline scale tests assert on. It is distilled from a device
rather than committed whole, so like the generated constants it is a snapshot,
and no offline check can notice the UNIT moving away from it. Since ADR-0022 it
could at least be checked against the committed payload, which is that record's
third open question; either way only a unit can say the catalog still reads
this way.

A failure here means the fixture is out of date. Regenerate and READ the diff:

    python scripts/extract_scale_fixture.py \
        --payload tests/fixtures/catalog/model_repo_coros_4_0_1.bin

A changed bound or taper is a real protocol change and belongs in
`docs/protocol.md` alongside the readings it invalidates.
