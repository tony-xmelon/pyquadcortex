"""ADR-0017's typed settings, against the real unit.

`tests/hardware/test_values.py` covers a parameter the CATALOG describes. These
are the settings it does not: an input port's gain, the Global EQ, the HOLD
threshold, the tuner reference. Their scales come from `units.SETTING_SPANS`
rather than from the device's own description, so "the unit agrees" is a
different claim here and worth its own file - if a span is wrong, offline tests
cannot know.

State-neutral per ADR-0005. An input gain in particular is something a player
has dialled in by ear, so every one of these snapshots first and restores in
teardown.

The reconnect-shaped delay is not ceremony either: a read straight after a write
returns the PREVIOUS value on this firmware, and `set_input_port(confirm=True)`
exists because that trap already cost this project a wrong conclusion.
