"""The catalog predicts the WIRE for every option, on everything reachable.

This is the evidence the rule rests on. `CLAUDE.md` says a structural fact about
an option list - how many choices it has and WHICH WIRE INDEX each one sits at -
is taken from the catalog without a screen reading, while anything about what a
PERSON SEES needs eyes. That split is only defensible while the structural half
keeps being right.

So this drives every position of every fixed list the loaded preset can reach
and asserts the unit stores ``index / (count - 1)``. 156 positions across 29
parameters on the preset of the 2026-09-15 run, zero mismatches. A failure here
is a finding about the device and it invalidates the rule, not just this test.

It proves the WIRE mapping and nothing else. The ORDER the unit draws a list's
choices in is presentational, this reads no screen, and `docs/domain-model.md`
records three lists that came back reversed when somebody transcribed them - so
a green run here never licenses skipping a reading.

It is batched: every parameter is set to position k, then ONE preset read
verifies them all, so the cost is one read per position rather than one per
parameter per position. On a full preset that is about 73 seconds.

State-neutral by recall: nothing here saves, so the teardown reloads the preset
and the grid returns to what the owner had. It refuses to start when the preset
already had unsaved edits before the session began, because a recall would
discard the owner's own work. Edits made by earlier tests are the suite's own.
