"""How long the device takes to echo a host write, by write type.

The watcher that confirms a write landed needs a timeout, and until now that
timeout was set from two measurements: parameters (113-116 ms) and block
placement (290-420 ms). Every other write type was assumed to fit inside the
same envelope. This measures the rest so the assumption stops being one.

Each test snapshots what it touches and registers a restore before writing, so
the run is state-neutral whether it passes or fails (ADR-0005).
