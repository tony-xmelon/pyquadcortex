"""The audited option lists still match the catalog this unit ships.

`tests/fixtures/catalog/option_readings.json` holds what a human read off the
screen, and `options.OPTION_AUDIT` stamps each list from it. Both are pinned to
a SNAPSHOT of the catalog, and like the generated constants no offline check can
notice the UNIT moving away from it - a firmware that renames an option would leave
every offline test green while the library published a word the unit no longer
uses, now with "audited" beside it, which is worse than never having checked.

So this holds the readings against the catalog the unit is running right now.
It does not re-read the screen: that needs eyes, and the readings record it
once. What it proves is that the thing that was read is still the thing that
ships - the model still exists, the parameter is still at that index, and it
still offers exactly those words in that order.

A failure here is a finding about the device, not a fixture to relax. Re-read the
changed list on the unit before touching the recorded screen text.
