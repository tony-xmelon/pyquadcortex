"""The hardware suite's bookkeeping, checked offline.

``tests/hardware/conftest.py`` does three things no hardware test can see for
itself, because each one is about a run rather than about the unit:

* it decides which phase report DECIDES an operation. A restore that failed is
  reported in ``teardown`` and nowhere else (``restores`` and
  ``scratch_preset`` both raise there), so a rule that reads only ``call``
  prints an operation under ``passed:`` on a run that left the unit changed -
  which is the one outcome ADR-0005 exists to make loud;
* it works out the four lines of the end-of-run report. The regression line is
  set arithmetic, and on ``QuadCortex`` - whose ``VERIFIED`` is ``EVERYTHING`` -
  the naive difference names every operation nobody has ever tested;
* it puts the unit back after ``scratch_preset``. The recall and the delete are
  independent failures, and the delete is the one that must happen anyway: it
  removes the copy, and the copy's name is fixed, so a leak makes the NEXT run
  ambiguous.

None of that needs a unit, so it is held here rather than being taken on trust
until somebody plugs one in. The conftest is loaded by path under its own module
name, the way ``tests/test_handshake_burst_recorder.py`` reaches
``HandshakeBurst``: without ``--hardware`` there is no other way into that
directory from the offline suite, and pytest's own copy of the module is
untouched by this.
