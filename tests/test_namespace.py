"""The two namespaces: the model at the top, the protocol layer one deeper.

`pyquadcortex.connect()` returns the model's `Device`; `pyquadcortex.protocol`
holds the message-level API this library shipped through 0.40.0, unchanged
except for where it is imported from (ADR-0006).

The parity test below is the one that matters. It reads a COMMITTED COPY of the
pre-flip `__init__.py`, taken verbatim from git at the last release before the
flip (94e5053, 0.40.0)::

    git show 94e5053:pyquadcortex/__init__.py \\
        > tests/fixtures/surface/pre_flip_init.py.txt

and asserts every name that file exported now resolves under
`pyquadcortex.protocol`. Nothing here is a hand-typed list, so a name dropped
during the move cannot be hidden by forgetting to add it to a checklist.

The fixture is a copy rather than a live `git show`, because CI checks the repo
out one commit deep (`actions/checkout@v4` defaults to `fetch-depth: 1`) and
94e5053 is not in that clone. A copy is only as good as what pins it, so the
fixture's exact size and content hash are asserted below: editing the fixture is
allowed, editing it quietly is not.
