    # These are how another test observes a write. That makes them exercised,
    # not verified: nothing asserts what the READ itself should return, so a
    # reader that lost a field would leave every test that uses it green.
    "global_eq": "the Global EQ gain test reads it back as its instrument; nothing asserts what global_eq() itself reports",
    "hold_timing_ms": "the HOLD threshold test reads it back as its instrument; nothing asserts the reader against a value set on the unit's own screen",

    # -- the preset library: writes that would touch the owner's own presets ---
    # The scratch_preset fixture is what these would be built on - it saves a
    # copy into a free User slot and deletes it again. The undo/redo test uses it.
    "save_current_preset": "the undo/redo test's scratch_preset fixture confirms a save into a free User slot, but the test verifies undo/redo rather than the save wire shape",
    "recall_preset": "no hardware test yet; a recall discards the loaded preset's unsaved edits, so it needs scratch_preset around it",
    "delete_preset": "the undo/redo test's scratch_preset teardown deletes its copy, but that delete is deliberately unconfirmed and a teardown asserts nothing",
    "copy_preset": "no hardware test yet; it writes into a second setlist, so a failed run leaves a stray preset in the owner's Directory",

    "move_block": "no hardware test yet; it needs a free cell and a block to move, both of which depend on the loaded preset",
    "write_preset": "no hardware test yet, and none is wanted: it is the wholesale grid path the row/column writes replaced (CLAUDE.md)",
    "set_chain_output": "no hardware test yet; the echo test drives the INPUT side, and an output write is audible on a rig that is plugged in",
    "reroute_grid_input": "no hardware test yet; it rewrites every row on a port at once, so a partial restore leaves the preset re-routed",
    "set_split": "no hardware test yet; branching a row changes what the player hears and needs a preset with a free slot to branch at",

    "set_output_level": "no hardware test yet; it is audible on a rig that is plugged in and takes Encoded only, so there is no screen value to assert against",
    "set_output_mute": "no hardware test yet; muting an output on a rig that is plugged in is audible in the worst direction",
    "set_output_pairing": "no hardware test yet; unpairing makes two ports stop sharing settings, so restoring the pairing does not restore the settings",
    "set_output_port": "no hardware test yet; the port settings are the owner's rig, and a partial restore leaves the wrong one in place",
    "set_usb_port": "no hardware test yet; the USB audio settings carry the link this suite runs over",
    "set_global_eq_band": "reached only by the Global EQ test's restore, which asserts nothing; the band write itself has no test",

    "set_global_eq_output": "no hardware test yet; it takes Encoded only, so there is no screen value a test could assert against",
    "set_global_bypass": "no hardware test yet; it bypasses Cab or IR blocks across ALL presets, which a failed restore leaves that way",

    "set_midi_thru": "no hardware test yet; MIDI Thru affects the rest of the rig and the change is invisible on the unit",
    "set_preset_load_midi_out": "no hardware test yet; it stores up to twelve messages on the preset, so the restore is the whole list read first",
    "set_gig_view": "no hardware test yet; it opens Gig View on the unit's screen, and nothing restores the screen the player left it on",
    "set_mode": "no hardware test yet; it changes which footswitch mode the player is looking at",
    "set_mode_cycle": "no hardware test yet; it rewrites the mode cycle the player configured for a gig",
    "set_tuner_input": "no hardware test yet; the tuner input is a rig decision and the write is invisible until the tuner is open",
    "set_tuner_mute": "no hardware test yet; it changes whether the unit goes silent when the player tunes on stage",
    "set_tuner_reference": "no hardware test yet; a reference pitch left off 440 is the kind of change nobody notices until a gig",
    "show_tuner": "measured to do NOTHING on firmware d14e (client.py), so there is no effect on the unit to assert",
    "restore_audio": "no hardware test yet; it undoes the silence a host tuner write causes, and nothing here writes the tuner",
    "show_capture_dialog": "answers a request the DEVICE makes; the suite cannot make the unit ask, so there is no state-neutral way to reach it",
    "add_favorite": "no hardware test yet; it edits the FAVORITES list the player uses to find presets on stage",
    "remove_favorite": "no hardware test yet; it can only run on a preset that is already a favourite, which is the owner's choice",
    "pin_model": "no hardware test yet; it reorders the device list the player picks blocks from",
    "unpin_model": "no hardware test yet; it removes EVERY entry for a model, so a restore has to know how many there were",

    # -- the metronome and the tempo block ------------------------------------
    # Audible by definition, and seven of the settings belong to the PRESET in
    # PRESET mode and to the device in GLOBAL mode - so which one a write lands
    # in depends on a switch test_tempo_mode.py moves.
    "set_metronome_running": "no hardware test yet; starting the metronome is audible, and its scope depends on the MODE switch test_tempo_mode.py moves",
    "set_metronome_muted": "no hardware test yet; the mute is only observable while the metronome is running, which is a second audible write",

    "set_metronome_sound": "no hardware test yet; it is audible and its scope depends on the MODE switch test_tempo_mode.py moves",
    "set_metronome_routing": "no hardware test yet; it decides which outputs the click reaches on a rig that is plugged in",

    "set_beats": "no hardware test yet; it writes several beats at once and is audible in the same way set_beat is",
    "set_time_signature": "no hardware test yet; it changes the bar the click counts, which is preset state in PRESET mode",
    "set_tempo_subdivision": "no hardware test yet; it is the metronome's SUBDIVISIONS by name and is audible while the click runs",
