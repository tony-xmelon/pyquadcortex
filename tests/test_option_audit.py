"""The screen readings behind `options.OPTION_AUDIT`.

`stepNames` is the catalog's vocabulary, and the catalog is not the unit's
screen. Where the two could be compared offline they disagreed: for the twelve
parameters whose list the device builds from the preset, the catalog writes
``In 1`` and ``Ret 1/2`` and the device writes ``Input 1`` and ``Return 1/2``.
So a list's names are a hypothesis until somebody reads them off the unit.

`tests/fixtures/catalog/option_readings.json` is where those readings live - one
row per POSITION, because "index 2 showed 'Gate'" is a fact that can be checked
and "this list is fine" is not. `scripts/generate_options.py` reads the file and
stamps each enum, so a list nobody has read says so in its own docstring rather
than looking identical to one that was checked.

What these tests protect is the honesty of that stamp: that a reading names a
list that exists, that "audited" means every position was read, and that the
counts move only when somebody changes them on purpose.
