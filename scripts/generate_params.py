"""Generate ``pyquadcortex/protocol/params.py`` - parameter constants per model.

A parameter is written by its wire INDEX. Indices are positional and several are
not visible knobs, so writing one by number is how you change stored data and
move nothing on screen. These constants make the index a name.

Source: a device's ModelRepo payload, either live or previously saved.

    # from a connected Quad Cortex (Cortex Control must be quit)
    python scripts/generate_params.py

    # from a saved payload, for reproducible regeneration
    python scripts/generate_params.py --payload model_repo_payload.bin

Three things this generator knows that the catalog does not:

1. **The catalog UNDER-DESCRIBES cabs.** It lists two parameters for a cab
   model - the two mic selectors - while the wire carries 22. Measured on four
   cabs across all four categories (Bass/Guitar, M/ST): every one is the
   ``Default Cabsim`` layout. So the 140 cab models share ONE layout and get one
   enum, rather than 140 two-member enums that would each hide 20 parameters.
2. **A cab's repeated block is a MICROPHONE**, not an IR slot or a channel.
   Confirmed against the unit's own editor: mic 1 read POSITION 2.9 / DIST 3.0
   and mic 2 read POSITION 5.6 / DIST 3.3, matching wire indices 5 and 13 at
   0.29/0.30 and 0.56/0.33. That is what maps a mic to an index; ordering alone
   would have been an assumption.
3. **An IR Loader's repeated block IS two IR slots**, which
   ``QuadCortex.set_ir(cell, ir, slot=)`` already drives at indices 2 and 10.

Only FACTORY content is emitted, for the same reason ``models.py`` does: a unit
may not have a purchased model, and capture ids are user slots. Resolve those at
runtime through ``qc.catalog``.
