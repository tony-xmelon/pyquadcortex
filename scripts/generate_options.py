"""Generate ``pyquadcortex/protocol/options.py`` - the choices a list offers.

A list-valued parameter stores ``index / (count - 1)`` on the wire, so choosing
"Lo Pass" means knowing it is the fourth entry. The names are in the device's
catalog, in a ``stepNames`` attribute this library read for the first time on
2026-08-26; before that ``set_param_option`` said they were "not in the catalog"
and made every caller pass a preset to read them from.

Source: a device's ModelRepo payload, either live or previously saved.

    python scripts/generate_options.py
    python scripts/generate_options.py --payload model_repo_payload.bin

Three decisions this generator makes:

1. **One enum per distinct LIST, not per parameter.** 527 parameters carry a
   fixed list and they use only 113 distinct ones, of which 110 get an enum,
   because the same list means the same thing everywhere: the note-length list is shared by ``SYNC NOTE``,
   ``SYNC NOTE L``, ``SYNC NOTE R``, ``SYNC NOTE A`` and ``SYNC NOTE B``. One
   enum per list is one enum per concept.
2. **``Off,On`` gets no enum.** 247 of those 527 offer exactly "Off" and "On",
   and ``OffOn.ON`` says nothing that ``True`` does not. Those parameters take a
   bool.
3. **The device's spelling is kept on the wire and corrected in the name.**
   ``OPTION_LABELS`` holds the strings verbatim, typos included, because a
   dynamic list is matched by string against the preset. ``SPELLING_FIXES``
   below corrects the MEMBER name only, one reviewed line at a time.
