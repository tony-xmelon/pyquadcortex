"""Distil the parameters under test out of a device ModelRepo into a fixture.

    python scripts/extract_scale_fixture.py --payload model_repo_payload.bin

The offline suite has to prove that the device's own catalog reproduces every
reading taken off the unit's screen. That needs real numbers. Committing the
catalog whole was once the thing this script existed to avoid; since ADR-0022
the 4.0.1 payload IS committed, at
``tests/fixtures/catalog/model_repo_coros_4_0_1.bin``, so that is no longer the
reason. What remains is that the fixture is the data under test, read by tests
that assert on a few dozen parameters and nothing else. Whether it should now
be derived from the committed payload rather than distilled by hand is
ADR-0022's third open question.

So the fixture holds only the parameters the tests actually assert on: for each,
its bounds, its taper and its floor. That is the data under test and nothing
else. ``tests/hardware/test_scales_on_unit.py`` proves the live catalog still agrees
with it, which is what stops the fixture drifting away from the device.

Regenerate whenever a reading is added to ``tests/test_scales.py`` for a
parameter not already listed in ``WANTED`` below.
