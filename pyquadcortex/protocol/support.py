"""The words a device profile is described in (ADR-0020).

A PROFILE is a client class: ``QuadCortex`` for a Quad Cortex on CorOS 4.0.1,
a subclass for each other unit somebody has measured. This module holds the
vocabulary those classes declare themselves with and the one function that
words a refusal, so the text cannot drift between the places that use it.

It imports nothing from the package on purpose: ``client.py`` needs these
names to guard its methods, and the profile classes need ``client.py``, so
this is the module both can import without a cycle.
