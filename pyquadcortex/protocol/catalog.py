"""The device's block catalog: what models exist, and what knobs they have.

A Quad Cortex identifies a grid block by an integer (``BinaryPreset.Model.hash``
on the wire). On its own that integer says nothing - you cannot tell 5005 is a
compressor, and you cannot tell which parameter index is "THRESHOLD". The device
resolves this itself with a **model repository** it sends to a connecting client:
a gzipped tar holding one ``ModelRepo.xml``, listing every model installed on
*that unit*, grouped into categories, each with its parameters in wire-index
order and their ranges.

This module turns that payload into a :class:`ModelCatalog`. Because it comes
from the device, the catalog automatically covers content that is not built in -
purchased plugin models in particular.

It does NOT enumerate Neural Captures. The Neural Capture category holds only a
couple of entries and does not grow when a capture is saved: a capture BLOCK is one
of those models and the capture it plays is a string parameter naming a library
file. Use :meth:`pyquadcortex.protocol.QuadCortex.captures` to browse what is available.

Which models are "factory" matters for the generated constants in
:mod:`pyquadcortex.protocol.models`: only models every unit is guaranteed to have belong
there. :attr:`Model.is_factory` encodes that rule (see the class docstring).

    #: hidden parameters.
    #:
    #: **It does not reliably mean "not on screen", and that was measured**
    #: (2026-09-14, CorOS 4.0.1). A block carrying each of the six lists used
    #: ONLY by hidden parameters was placed on the grid and the named control
    #: looked for on every page of that block. Five were genuinely not drawn: a
    #: Soldano SLO-100's ``CHANNEL``, an IR loader's ``INVERT``, a Gojira REV's
    #: ``MIX LAW``, a Slapback Delay's ``QUALITY`` and a Plini Delay's ``DYN
    #: MODE``. The sixth, a Mono Synth's ``OSC1 WAVE``, **is on the screen** -
    #: on a tab called Oscillator, drawn as waveform icons, alongside
    #: ``OSC1 ACTIVE`` which this flag also marks hidden.
    #:
    #: So do not build behaviour on it. `options.OPTION_AUDIT` deliberately does
    #: not: a list is stamped unreadable only where somebody looked and it was
    #: not there, never because of this flag. ADR-0010 is the precedent - a
    #: plausible rule about a parameter attribute, disproved on the unit.
    #:
    #: What the flag IS good for is a hint about where to look first, and it is
    #: read per PARAMETER rather than per name. The Soldano is the proof: it

    #: The raw string is NOT kept - this is a bool - so a Mini profile wanting
    #: that distinction has to re-read the attribute from the XML rather than
    #: from here. Left that way deliberately: no Mini has been measured, and a
    #: field shaped for one would be a guess about what it needs. That also
    #: makes the value a second, independent sign that ATMA is the Mini, which
