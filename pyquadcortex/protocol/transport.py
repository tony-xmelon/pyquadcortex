"""Framed protobuf transport over an hidapi-like device.

``Transport`` moves logical protobuf messages across a USB-HID device that
speaks the Quad Cortex framed protocol. It:

  * frames outbound messages into 129-byte HID output reports (via ``framing``)
    and writes them;
  * runs a background RX thread that reads input reports, reassembles
    multi-report messages, decodes them, and correlates responses to callers by
    ``request_id``;
  * hands every decoded message to any persistent listener (``add_listener``),
    which is how a long-lived caller sees the unsolicited pushes no waiter is
    expecting;
  * runs a background keepalive thread that periodically pokes the device so it
    keeps the session alive.

The transport deals only in ``framing`` (bytes <-> ``framing.Frame``) and
``registry`` (type tag <-> protobuf class). The envelope is confirmed against
a real Cortex Control session (see docs/protocol.md).
Write errors are EXPECTED: the QC stalls every SET_REPORT's status stage after
consuming the data (see ``_write_report``), so writes that "fail" succeeded.

Thread-safety / robustness notes:
  * ``_pending`` (request_id -> waiter) is guarded by ``_lock``; each request is
    popped by exactly one of the RX thread (on reply) or the requesting thread
    (on timeout), so no entry leaks and no double-delivery occurs.
  * The RX thread must never die: every per-message decode/parse is wrapped so a
    malformed frame or unknown message type is logged and skipped, and the
    reassembly buffer is reset so one bad frame cannot wedge the stream.
  * Listeners run ON the RX thread, so the same rule covers them: one that raises
    is logged and skipped, and one may not issue a correlated read (``request``,
    ``await_broadcast``, ``collect`` refuse to run on that thread - see
    ``_refuse_read_from_rx``).
  * The keepalive thread swallows send failures and keeps going.

        """Register ``listener`` to see EVERY decoded inbound message.

        The transport's other three inbound hooks are one-shot and scoped to a
        trigger: :meth:`request` correlates one reply, :meth:`await_broadcast`
        waits for one push, :meth:`collect` gathers for a fixed number of
        seconds. A listener is none of those. It stays registered until it is
        removed and sees every message the RX thread decodes - including the
        unsolicited pushes no waiter is expecting, which :meth:`_dispatch` would
        otherwise drop at debug level. That is what a push-fed cache needs (see
        ``docs/domain-model.md`` section 9).

        ``listener`` is called as ``listener(message)`` with the parsed protobuf.

        Additive by construction: a listener does not CONSUME a message. It is
        notified first, and the message then reaches every collector and waiter
        exactly as it would have with no listener registered.

        **Treat the message as read-only.** It is not a copy: the object handed to
        a listener is the same one the next listener and the waiter receive, so a
        listener that normalizes or tidies it in place changes what they see.
        Read what you need out of it and merge that into your own state.

        Registration and removal are safe while the RX thread is running.
        Returns a zero-argument callable that removes this registration;
        :meth:`remove_listener` does the same job for a caller who kept the
        listener rather than the callable.

        **Listeners run on the RX thread**, synchronously, in registration order,
        before the message reaches its waiter (so a cache fed by a listener is
        already current when the blocked caller wakes). Two consequences:

        * **A listener must not block.** It spends the RX thread's time: whatever
          it does delays the next report being read. Apply the push and return.
        * **A listener may not read from the device**, and that is enforced
          rather than asked for: :meth:`request`, :meth:`await_broadcast` and
          :meth:`collect` raise ``RuntimeError`` when called from the RX thread
          (see ``_refuse_read_from_rx``). Such a call could never have worked -
          the RX thread is the one that delivers replies, so a wait from inside
          it can never be satisfied - and the rule it breaks is older than this
          method: the RX thread applies pushes and notes what needs re-reading,
          and the caller's thread does the re-reading
          (``docs/domain-model.md`` section 9). :meth:`send` is NOT refused,
          being fire-and-forget, but a listener that writes owns the delay it
          adds to the read loop.

        A listener that raises is logged and skipped: the RX thread survives, the
        other listeners still see that message, and the message still reaches its
        waiter. Same contract as every other step in this module's RX path, and
        wider than the rest of it - ``BaseException``, not just ``Exception``,
        because ``pytest.fail()`` and ``sys.exit()`` are ordinary things for
        caller code to do and neither may cost the connection its read loop.

        A listener lives only as long as the connection. Device loss neither
        removes nor notifies listeners - there is simply nothing further to
        deliver - and a new connection means a new ``Transport`` and a new
        registration.

        Evidence: the mechanism is proven offline against ``FakeHid``
        (``tests/test_transport.py``). That a listener registered before the
        connect handshake sees the handshake's state burst is confirmed on
        hardware (``tests/hardware/test_broadcast_listener.py``). Registering
        that early needs ``protocol.connect(before_handshake=...)``, because
        ``connect`` runs the handshake before it hands the client back.

        Raises:
            DeviceLostError: if the device is already known to be gone.

        ``listener``, which is what makes ``remove_listener(self._apply)`` work
        for a bound method: each attribute access builds a new object, and those
        compare equal. Two consequences of that, neither of them a problem unless
        it is a surprise: registering the same callable twice registers it twice
        and it is then called twice per message, needing one removal each; and a
        listener whose class defines ``__eq__`` can have an equal-but-different
        registration removed instead of the one passed.

        Safe to call from inside a listener, though the message being delivered
