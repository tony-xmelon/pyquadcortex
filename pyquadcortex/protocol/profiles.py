"""The device profiles this library knows, and how a connection picks one.

A profile is a client class (ADR-0020). ``QuadCortex`` in ``client.py`` is the
Quad Cortex on CorOS 4.0.1 and the base of every other profile. This module
holds the two profiles we know are coming and have not measured, and the
registry ``connect()`` resolves through. Adding a profile is: subclass
``QuadCortex``, declare the class attributes, and the registry sees it.

    PR #42's description (2026-09-03) reports ``pytest --hardware``: 2742
    passed, 8 skipped, on a Quad Cortex running CorOS 4.1.0 / app firmware
    d14e, by tony-xmelon. That is a contributor's report and the maintainer has
    not reproduced it, which is what ``Evidence.CONTRIBUTED`` says here. The
    connection is therefore known to work with this handshake and announce
    string. ``capture_screen`` has a dated 4.1.0 hardware-test result;
    ``tap_screen`` was directly verified on 2026-09-27 at (100, 147): it opened
    the Plugins chooser on an empty Grid and the second tap restored the Grid.
    ``preset_screenshot`` and ``create_local_backup`` also have dated 4.1.0
    captures, and the contributed device-name round trip verified
    ``set_device_name``. All five are VERIFIED. Other inherited operations
    refuse under ``Support.VERIFIED`` and run with a warning under
    ``Support.EXPERIMENTAL``. The snapshot is deliberately absent: binding the
    4.0.1 constants would hand a 4.1 user names their unit does not use.

    To finish this profile, on a 4.1 unit:

    1. ``scripts/generate_models.py --snapshot coros_4_1_0`` and the params and
       options generators; bind the three modules below.
    2. ``pytest tests/hardware --hardware --profile QuadCortex41``; the report
       at the end lists the operations whose tests passed. Put those names in
       ``VERIFIED``.
    3. Record any operation that behaved differently in ``docs/protocol.md``
       beside the 4.0.1 record, dated and named, and override it here.
