    PR #42's description (2026-09-03) reports ``pytest --hardware``: 2742
    passed, 8 skipped, on a Quad Cortex running CorOS 4.1.0 / app firmware
    d14e, by tony-xmelon. That is a contributor's report and the maintainer has
    not reproduced it, which is what ``Evidence.CONTRIBUTED`` says here.
    ``create_local_backup`` has its own dated 4.1.0 capture. The contributed
    device-name round trip also verified ``set_device_name``; both are VERIFIED.
    Other inherited operations refuse under ``Support.VERIFIED`` and run with
    a warning under ``Support.EXPERIMENTAL``. The snapshot is deliberately absent:
    binding the 4.0.1 constants would hand a 4.1 user names their unit does not
    use.

    To finish this profile, on a 4.1 unit:

    1. ``scripts/generate_models.py --snapshot coros_4_1_0`` and the params and
       options generators; bind the three modules below.
    2. ``pytest tests/hardware --hardware --profile QuadCortex41``; the report
       at the end lists the operations whose tests passed. Put those names in
       ``VERIFIED``.
    3. Record any operation that behaved differently in ``docs/protocol.md``
       beside the 4.0.1 record, dated and named, and override it here.
