"""The device profiles this library knows, and how a connection picks one.

A profile is a client class (ADR-0020). ``QuadCortex`` in ``client.py`` is the
Quad Cortex on CorOS 4.0.1 and the base of every other profile. This module
holds the measured CorOS 4.1 profile, the unmeasured Mini profile, and the
registry ``connect()`` resolves through. Adding a profile is: subclass
``QuadCortex``, declare the class attributes, and the registry sees it.

    Contributor hardware run on 2026-09-11 (fork commit ``99a5cd5``), combining
    this profile with PR #62's live-preset fix, passed 95 tests with 4
    fixture-dependent skips and all 16 claimed operations green on CorOS 4.1.0 /
    app firmware d14e. The maintainer has not reproduced that run, which is what
    ``Evidence.CONTRIBUTED`` says here. Profile-aware runs measured the
    operations in ``VERIFIED`` below. ``create_local_backup`` also has its own
    dated 4.1.0 capture, and the separately contributed device-name round trip
    verifies ``set_device_name``. Every operation omitted from ``VERIFIED``
    refuses under ``Support.VERIFIED`` and runs with a warning under
    ``Support.EXPERIMENTAL``. ``read_current_preset`` was measured only with
    PR #62's retry implementation
    and remains guarded until that dependency lands. Its generated constants
    are bound to the contributed CorOS 4.1.0 snapshot rather than the 4.0.1
    compatibility imports.

    To finish this profile, on a 4.1 unit:

    1. ``pytest tests/hardware --hardware --profile QuadCortex41``; the report
       at the end lists the operations whose tests passed. Put those names in
       ``VERIFIED``.
    2. Record any operation that behaved differently in ``docs/protocol.md``
