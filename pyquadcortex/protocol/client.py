"""High-level QuadCortex client for pyquadcortex.protocol.

This is the ergonomic API a caller (CLI, script) uses to control a Quad Cortex.
It builds protobuf messages and hands them to a ``transport``-like object,
which is dependency-injected via the constructor. The transport exposes:

  * ``send(message)``                  - fire-and-forget
  * ``request(message, timeout=...)``  - send and block for the correlated reply

The client deliberately knows NOTHING about hidapi, HID reports, or the framing
layer: it only speaks protobuf messages. That keeps this layer testable with a
fake transport and keeps all wire concerns in ``framing``/``transport``.

**Rows and columns are ZERO-BASED; the unit displays rows 1 to 4.** So ``row=0``
is the top row on screen, and ``row=2`` is the one labelled 3. Getting this wrong
is quiet rather than loud - an edit lands on a real row, just not the one intended,
and it reads back perfectly. When a change is meant to be audible, check which row
actually reaches a physical output: ``chain.out_portid`` values 16 to 18 are internal
row-to-row routing rather than jacks, though 19 (``MULTIPLE``) is a real destination.

Field semantics were confirmed against real Cortex Control 4.0.1 sessions:
session connect, preset recall (user AND factory setlists), scene switch, grid
bypass/param writes, Save As, delete, and move are all reproduced verbatim from
observed traffic. ``copy_scene`` came from a different source, because Cortex
Control has no scene-copy feature to observe: its shape was read off the device's
own broadcast when a scene was copied on the unit. It too is fully confirmed on
hardware, including its ``from_index`` and ``swap`` behaviour. See
``docs/protocol.md`` for the per-operation coverage table.

    something other than a float. It is deliberately not an exception: this runs
    as a match predicate, where the right response to a message that cannot

    Two things here are not decoration.

    **The explicit ``index`` wins over position.** ``Param.index`` is
    presence-tracked, the device sets it on every param of a captured push
    (checked: all 25, and there it equals position), and this library's own writes
    set it. Reading positionally while the device keys by index is the
    ``ColBypass.column`` mistake in a new place - it works until the device sends
    a sparse or reordered list, and then it returns a neighbouring tempo
    parameter as the answer. The neighbours are 0.0/1.0 floats too, so the wrong
    answer would round cleanly and look right. Same fallback as
    ``set_block.echoes_cell``: trust the index when present, use position when not.

    **``ParamValue.value`` is a REAL oneof**, not a synthetic one - ``int_value``,
    ``float_value``, ``string_value``. Reading ``.float_value`` off a param that
    holds an int yields 0.0 with no error, which would report PRESET with total

        ``is_factory`` is inferred from ``setlist_path``.

        Confirmed by capture and live probe: there is NO
        host-initiated "read preset" request - a ``GridMessage``/``RecallPreset``
        READ gets no reply. Instead the device BROADCASTS a ``RecallPreset``
        push (its ``preset`` field carrying the full BinaryPreset, often
        gzip-compressed - the transport decompresses it) whenever a preset is
        recalled, by host or by the unit. So this recalls the slot and captures
        that push. NOTE: this DOES load the preset onto the grid (it is not a
        side-effect-free read); the device services the push lazily (10-25s
        observed), hence the generous timeout.

        **The recall INTERRUPTS THE AUDIO - every time, including when it recalls
        the preset already loaded.** Measured by ear across four consecutive
        recalls: three redundant ones of the same preset and one genuine change,
        and all four cut the sound; only the duration differed (the real change
        was longer). Loading a preset reloads the engine, so this is expected
        device behaviour rather than a fault - but it means a verify-by-re-reading
        loop built on this method stutters a rig on EVERY iteration, even when
        nothing changes. It also resets the active scene and discards unsaved
        edits. Use :meth:`read_current_preset` for inspection: it reads the live
        grid with no side effects at all.

        Correlation, confirmed on hardware: the RecallPreset push a host
        recall triggers echoes that recall's ``request_id``, while the
        unsolicited seed push (hello's subscription grid state) carries none.
        Without matching on the id, the waiter returns whatever RecallPreset
        arrives first - which lags by one recall when a prior push is still in
        flight (the seed seeds the lag). So tag the recall with a fresh
        request_id and accept only the push echoing it.

        :class:`~pyquadcortex.protocol.enums.Instrument`).

        The device always reports a setlist as its full complement of 256 slots,
        most of which are typically empty. By default only occupied slots are
        returned; pass ``include_empty=True`` for the complete slot map, e.g. to
        find a free slot to save into.

        ``setlist`` is any folder KEY the device reports, not only the two
        setlists: plugin artist folders and the Captures Library work too, and
        :meth:`list_folders` enumerates all of them. Confirmed by listing
        ``"106_f"`` (three "Darkglass VMT" captures) and a plugin artist folder.

        Unlike :meth:`read_preset`, this does not change what is loaded on the
        grid. There is no host-initiated "list" request: a ``File`` READ makes the
        device push a folder listing per setlist, so this sends that READ and
        waits for the listing whose key matches ``setlist``.

        A listing that arrives is COMPLETE - five READs against an 18-preset setlist
        each produced a full listing, and no short one has been observed. But a READ
        does not reliably produce one promptly: two of those five saw nothing for
        that setlist within 8 s, delivery being lazy. So treat a timeout as "ask
        again", which is what :meth:`wait_for_listing` does, rather than as an
        answer about the setlist's contents.

        Note the trailing-slash asymmetry the match has to absorb: recalls need
        the factory path WITH its trailing slash (Cortex Control sends it that
        way), but the device reports that same folder's listing key WITHOUT one.
        Keys are therefore compared with trailing slashes normalized away.

        addresses you can write to directly.

        Confirmed shape: a knob change streams ``Grid{UPDATE, preset{chains{row,
        <collection>{<key>, params{index, param_values[scene]{float_value}}}}}}``,
        where the collection and the key come from the target - a block keys by
        ``column``, the lane output, input gate and mixer by ``hash``, the
        splitter by neither, and tempo hangs off the preset rather than a chain.
        A keyed sparse update is the ONLY way an edit persists; a full-preset
        write is dropped. Save the grid afterwards to keep it.

        ``param`` is a NAME or a wire index. Naming is the safer route - indices
        are positional and not every one is a visible knob, so a cab's index 0 is
        an internal ``ir selector`` that changes stored data and moves nothing on
        screen. Naming a parameter on a :class:`Block` needs its ``model_id``,
        because what is in a cell is whatever the player put there; every other
        target knows its own model.

        **The value says which SCALE it is on**, because every knob has two:
        the one the screen shows and the device's own 0.0 to 1.0. See
        :mod:`pyquadcortex.protocol.values`.

        * :class:`~pyquadcortex.protocol.values.Real` and the unit types -
          ``Db``, ``Percent``, ``Hertz``, ``Milliseconds``, ``Seconds``,
          ``Semitones``, ``Cents``, ``Bpm`` - are the screen's scale. They
          convert through the catalog's own description of the parameter, so
          they apply any taper and REFUSE a value the knob has no position for
          rather than clamping. A unit type also checks itself against the
          catalog's unit. They need a catalog, which comes from the device.
        * :class:`~pyquadcortex.protocol.values.Encoded` is the device's scale.
          It converts nothing and needs no catalog, which is what keeps an
          index-addressed write free of a round trip.
        * A plain ``str`` writes a string-valued parameter, such as a cab's
          microphone.

        A bare number is refused: on a lane VOLUME ``Real(0.0)`` is unity and
        ``Encoded(0.0)`` is silence, and nothing in a plain ``0.0`` says which
        was meant.

        One parameter refuses a real value outright: ``NC_Recorder``'s ``OUT
        LEVEL``, whose bounds the catalog names and nobody can measure, because
        placing that block crashes the unit.

        **Per-scene values.** Name a ``scene`` to change that scene alone::

            # index 0 with no model id, so the catalog cannot be asked what
            # scale this knob is on - the device's own is all there is
            qc.set_param(Block(2, 5), 0, Encoded(0.8), scene=Scene.D)

        Three things had to line up for this, all confirmed on hardware:

        1. The device honours ``param_values[0]`` against whichever scene is
           **active** - the index is not a scene selector, so nothing is padded.
        2. It only keeps per-scene values for a parameter whose ``scene_mode`` is
           set, so naming a scene promotes the parameter first (pass
           ``promote=False`` to skip that if you know it is already set).
        3. The device accepts **either** the flag **or** a value in one message,
           never both: sent together, the flag is silently dropped. So this
           issues the promotion, the scene switch and the write as three
           messages, and leaves the unit sitting on that scene - a visible side
           effect.

        Without ``scene``, the write lands on the active scene, which for a
        parameter that is not scene-following is its single global value and so
        appears in all eight.

        Unlike parameters, bypass really is per scene - but not by index.
        Confirmed on hardware: the device applies ``sceneBypass[0]`` to whichever
        scene is ACTIVE and ignores any entry beyond it. So:

        * without ``scene``, this changes the block in the currently active scene;
        * with ``scene`` (a :class:`~pyquadcortex.protocol.enums.Scene`), the unit is first
          switched to that scene, which is a visible side effect worth knowing
          about - the unit is left sitting there.

        Ordering over the pipe is enough for that pair; no settle delay is needed.

        Blocks only follow scenes when their ``ColBypass.sceneMode`` is set. For a
        block without it, bypass is one global state: the write lands on ALL EIGHT
        stored scene slots at once (measured - a fresh block took a single write
        across every slot). ``sceneMode`` itself is NOT host-writable: sent alone
        and sent beside a bypass entry, both were ignored. Factory content arrives
        with it set; the unit's own UI is presumably what sets it.

        **A Neural Capture block loses this write at its FIRST save.** A bypass
        written to a capture block in the same session that first PLACES it reads
        back correctly from :meth:`read_current_preset`, survives unrelated edits -
        and is dropped by the save that first materialises the capture, while an
        ordinary block in the same row keeps it. (Same family as the capture load
        resetting parameters, though parameters written after the load DO survive
        the save; bypass does not.) The sequence that persists, field-verified on
        24 presets and reproduced here::

            qc.save_current_preset(...)            # materialises the capture
            qc.recall_preset(...)                  # the stored slot

            qc.save_current_preset(...)            # same name, same slot: no rename

        Verify with :func:`bypass_state` on the STORED preset, not just the live
        grid.

        **The trap that looks like a refused write:** :meth:`read_preset` RECALLS
        the slot it reads, which resets the active scene to the preset's default.
        A read interleaved between :meth:`switch_scene` and this write silently
        retargets the write at the default scene - which is how a field session
        concluded capture blocks ignore bypass, and how the first three probes
        here reproduced that conclusion. Inspect with :meth:`read_current_preset`

        Confirmed on hardware (2026-08-12) by capturing every field of every
        message the device answers in each switch position and diffing the two:
        exactly one field moved, this one. The tempo actually in effect
        corroborates it from a second direction - the unit displayed 111 bpm in
        PRESET with the preset block holding 0.355, and 120 bpm in GLOBAL with the
        device block holding 0.400.

        **The device emits no CHANGE EVENT when the switch moves** - three earlier
        investigations watched for one and correctly found none. The current VALUE
        is a different matter: it rides the ambient ``GlobalTempo`` params push,
        which arrived twice per 14-second window in each of the three captures
        (against 63 clock-shaped pushes in the same window). So a state tracker CAN
        follow this field from pushes; what it cannot do is be told the moment it
        moves.

        That is also why the timeout is generous. ``GlobalTempo`` alternates two
        shapes and only one carries parameters, so this waits for that shape
        specifically rather than taking the first ``GlobalTempo`` to arrive - which
        is how a single earlier READ came back holding only the running clock and
        got written up as a dead end.

        **A read straight after a write returns the PREVIOUS value, and "a moment"
        is not long enough.** This type does not echo ``request_id`` - zero of 64
        captured pushes carried one - so this returns the next AMBIENT params push,
        which may have been generated before your write. That shape arrives only
        about every seven seconds, so **wait longer than that interval** - ten
        seconds is the figure the hardware suite uses. Observed directly: a write
        followed by a 3-second settle read back the old value, while the write had
        landed and every read afterwards agreed.

        A caller who needs certainty rather than a settle should discard the first
        matching push and take the second, which cannot predate the call.

        read before it writes. The choice is deliberate: enforcement lands at the

        switched off from here.

        Two scales are not what they look like:

        * **Brightness is quantized.** Writing 30 read back as 31 and 60 as 59, so
          the device stores it on a coarser internal scale.
        * **``dimmed_led_brightness`` is capped just under ``led_brightness``** -
          the dimmed value has to be dimmer. Asking for 100 landed on 25 with
          ``led_brightness`` at 28, on 9 with it at 13, and on 56 with it at 59. So
          raise ``led_brightness`` first if you want a high dimmed value.
        * **``hold_timing`` is an INDEX, not milliseconds.** The unit offers six
          values - 500 to 1000 ms in 100 ms steps - and the field is the index into
          them, confirmed by reading 3 over USB while the screen showed 800 ms. So
          ``ms = 500 + 100 * hold_timing``. The device does NOT validate it: 0 and
          5000 both round-tripped, so only 0-5 are meaningful. Use
          :meth:`set_hold_timing` to pass milliseconds and have this checked.

        **Top-level fields are sparse, but a SUBMESSAGE is replaced wholesale.**
        Sending ``master_volume_assignment`` with one flag set leaves the other
        three false. Use :meth:`set_master_volume_assignment` and

        ``GeneralSettings.hold_timing`` is that index, confirmed by reading 3 while

        the unit's FIXED hold gestures: hold TEMPO for the Tuner, BANK DOWN +
        TEMPO for Gig View, and the touchscreen tap-and-holds. Shortening it to
        500 ms makes the Tuner open sooner, which is how it was pinned.

        So the manual's "its assigned HOLD action" is loose wording: nothing binds
        a hold to a footswitch on this firmware, and there is no hold event to
        observe.

        The device accepts any integer in that field without validation, storing 0

        output level and temporarily deactivates the hardware wheel", so Cortex
        Control is writing this field rather than using some other route.

        Master volume is a gain stage of its own, applied downstream of the stored
        port levels - writing it changes no ``IOSettings`` level. Use
        :meth:`set_master_volume_assignment` to choose which outputs it governs.

        Out-of-range values are REJECTED rather than sent. The wire is 0..1 while
        the unit displays 0-100, so ``set_master_volume(Encoded(30))`` is the
        obvious mistake, and what the device does with 30.0 is unknown on a
        control that feeds an amplifier. Same reasoning as
        :meth:`set_hold_timing`: a field the device does not range-check itself is
        one this library range-checks for it.

        the unit does not open anything by itself: the device broadcasts
        ``NeuralCapture{try_to_show_dialog: true}`` and waits for the connected host
        to reply. With no reply the tap appears to do nothing at all - the unit simply
        returns to the grid - which is what made this feature look inert while a host
        was attached.

        So a client that wants the flow has to answer::

            NeuralCapture{UPDATE, show_dialog: true}

        The message also carries ``show_dialog_fail_reason``, a string, for refusing
        with an explanation.

        **Do not answer this unless you are implementing the capture UI.** The dialog
        is the HOST's to draw - the unit hands its capture flow to a connected editor,
        which is what Cortex Control's Neural Capture does. Replying ``true`` from a
        library that draws nothing puts the device into the flow with no interface
        anywhere: the device reported ``state: 1`` and prepared its A/B model while the
        unit's own screen stayed on the grid.

        Worse, staying SILENT is not neutral either - the unit waits for the answer and
        its own wizard never opens, so simply being connected suppresses on-device
        capture. To use the unit's wizard, disconnect first.

        Creating a capture is not implemented here. The engine is reachable though:
        the catalog's Neural Capture Internal category holds ``NC_Recorder``,
        ``NC_Trainer`` and ``NC_Refiner``, whose parameters are the controls (START
        TRAINING, SET SEED, CANCEL TRAINING, START AUTO REFINE, SET LATENCY, OUTPUT
        GAIN, EXPORT MODEL) and whose meters report progress, loss and a sanity check.

        eleven deletes a listing five seconds later still showed all eleven
        presets - they had in fact all gone. A fixed sleep therefore produces
        false negatives, which in a careful script reads as "the clear failed"

        ``default_scene`` sets which scene the preset comes up in. There is no
        field for it in the File message: the device records whichever scene is
        ACTIVE at save time, so this switches to that scene first and the saved
        preset's ``default_scene`` reads back accordingly. Note the side effect -
        the unit is left on that scene.

        **The device may not use the name you asked for.** If the setlist already
        contains a preset of that name, it de-duplicates: the base is truncated as
        needed and a ``_N`` suffix appended, to 20 characters total, so saving a
        second ``"Cali Basswalk [Ret1]"`` yields ``"Cali Basswalk [Ret_1"``. A
        unique name is stored verbatim and is not length-limited (36 characters
        was stored intact). If the resulting name matters, read the slot back and
        use what the device reports.

        Confirmed by capture: Cortex Control's "Save As" is a
        ``FileMessage`` with action CREATE (unset, the default), ``type: 0``,
        and NO preset payload - the device saves the preset it already has on
        the grid. The target slot is addressed inside ``folder``: the setlist's
        device path in ``folder.key`` and one ``files`` entry carrying the
        LINEAR slot index (bank*8 + letter, zero-based: "28E" == 220), the
        preset name, and the instrument tag (captured save sent
        ``instrument: 2``). Saving to slot 28E as "Test save to user sl" sent
        exactly ``{folder{key: "/media/p4/Presets/My Presets",
        is_factory: false, files{index: 220, name: ..., instrument: 2}}}``.

        ``instrument`` is the tag the unit filters on, and is the only preset
        metadata this can set. The descriptive ``tags`` a factory preset carries
        ('Clean', 'Crunch') are NOT reproduced: a preset saved this way reads back
        with an EMPTY tag list whatever its source had, and no route to them was
        found on this firmware - not ``ProductData.tags`` on this message, not a
        File UPDATE carrying them, not a ``Grid`` UPDATE carrying
        ``preset.tags``. All three are accepted and leave the list empty. Nothing
